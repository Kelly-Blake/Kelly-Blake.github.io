  <h1> Kelly Blake </h1> 
        <p> This website is dedicated to the many professional accomplishments I have made.
            I am a Marketing major with a minor in Public Relations graduating from the University of Rhode Island in May 2021. 
            I grew up in Newark, Delaware and love to travel. 
            I have made many accomplishments during my college career including being a part of the womens swimming and diving team at URI to starting the first ever sales club, the rhodyrainmakers.
