  <h1> About Me </h1> 
        <p>  On this page I will tell you about myself. My name is Kelly Blake, I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Marketing with a minor in Public Relations. 
            I love to travel and have been to over 13 different countries. I have studied abroad in Italy twice, once in the Calabria region spending a summer learning Italian. 
            The other I spent in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, specifically in Udine learning about international supply chain. I am very grateful for the opportunity to travel abroad and learn about Italian culture. 
            I also love to run and have ran both a half-marathon and a full marathon. I started running when I was in highschool when I ran track for one season.
