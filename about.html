            20 This website is dedicated to the many professional accomplishments I have made.
            On this page I will tell you about myself. My name is Kelly Blake, I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island majoring in Marketing with a minor in Public Relations.
            I love to travel and have been to over 13 different countries. I have studied abroad in Italy twice, once in the Calabria region spending a summer learning Italian. 
            The other I spent in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, specifically in Udine learning about international supply chain. <strong> The picture of the mountain is part of the Italian Alps mountain range in Udine, Italy. </strong>
            I am very grateful for the opportunity to travel abroad and learn about Italian culture. I also love to run and have ran both a half-marathon and a full marathon. 
            I started running when I was in highschool when I ran track for one season. I have 2 corgis, Hans and Lilly, and they are very friendly and love people. <strong> In the picture of my dogs at the beach, Hans has the blue leash and Lilly has the pink. </strong>
